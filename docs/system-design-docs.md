# System Design Documents

This document outlines the system design for the Real-Time Vocabulary Quiz application. It includes detailed information about the architecture, components, data flow, and technology choices.

## Architecture Diagram

Please refer to the architecture diagram in `system-design.png` which illustrates how different components of the system interact, including:
- Server components
- Client applications
- Database systems
- External services

## Component Descriptions

### Frontend Client
- React-based web application
- Handles user interactions and real-time updates
- Manages quiz session state and user interface
- Implements WebSocket connections for real-time features

### Backend Server
- Spring Boot application serving as the main API server
- Manages quiz sessions and user participation
- Handles real-time score calculations
- Coordinates WebSocket connections for live updates

### Database Layer
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Redis for caching and real-time leaderboard management
- Stores quiz data, user sessions, and scoring information

### WebSocket Service
- Handles real-time communication between clients and server
- Manages quiz session subscriptions
- Broadcasts score updates and leaderboard changes

## Data Flow

1. **Quiz Session Initialization**
   - User requests to join a quiz using unique quiz ID
   - Server validates session and user credentials
   - WebSocket connection established for real-time updates

2. **Quiz Participation**
   - User receives quiz questions through WebSocket
   - Answers are submitted to server for validation
   - Scores are calculated and broadcast to all participants

3. **Leaderboard Updates**
   - Server processes score updates
   - Redis cache updated with new rankings
   - Changes broadcast to all session participants
   - Persistent storage updated periodically

## Technologies and Tools

### Frontend
- **React**: For building interactive user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code development
- **Socket.io-client**: For WebSocket communications
- **TailwindCSS**: For responsive and modern UI design

### Backend
- **Spring Boot**: Main application framework
- **WebSocket**: For real-time communications
- **JPA/Hibernate**: For database operations
- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for persistent storage
- **Redis**: For caching and real-time data management

### Development Tools
- **Docker**: For containerization and deployment
- **Git**: For version control
- **Maven/Gradle**: For dependency management
- **Jest/JUnit**: For testing

## Performance Considerations

- WebSocket connections are managed efficiently to handle multiple concurrent users
- Redis caching improves leaderboard performance
- Database queries are optimized for quick response times
- Frontend optimizations for smooth real-time updates

## Scalability Strategy

- Horizontal scaling of backend services
- Load balancing for distributed traffic
- Microservices and Database sharding (shard by quiz_id) for large datasets
- Caching strategies for improved performance

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Logging framework for tracking system behavior
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking and reporting
- Regular backup and recovery procedures
